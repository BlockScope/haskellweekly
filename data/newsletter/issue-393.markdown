  > A blog on refactoring Haskell code posed an interesting problem. It is a variation on a standard type of problem which asks you to find the keyword present in a list of strings â€“ namely the opposite. It asks you to find whether a string has any one of the given keywords, i.e. find if the haystack has any one needle out of a given set of needles.
