Welcome to another issue of Haskell Weekly!
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org) is a safe, purely functional programming language with a fast, concurrent runtime.
This is a weekly summary of what's going on in its community.

## Featured

- [Celebrating the release of Amazonka 2.0](https://exploring-better-ways.bellroy.com/celebrating-the-release-of-amazonka-2-0.html) by Mike Webb
  > Today, we at Bellroy are pleased to discuss our role in the the 2.0 release of Amazonka â€” a vital Haskell package providing bindings for the AWS (Amazon Web Services) infrastructure - and how we think about open source.
  
- [GHC plugin for HLint](https://www.haskellforall.com/2023/09/ghc-plugin-for-hlint.html) by Gabriella Gonzalez
  > At work I was recently experimenting with running hlint (the widely used Haskell linting program) as a GHC plugin. One reason why I was interested in this is because we have a large (6000+ module) Haskell codebase at work, and I wanted to see if this would make it cheaper to run hlint on our codebase.

- [XML stream processing with Haskell](https://martin.hoppenheit.info/blog/2023/xml-stream-processing-with-haskell/) by Martin Hoppenheit
  > Memory-efficient processing of large XML documents requires the use of a streaming parser. This post gives an introduction to XML stream processing with the Haskell programming language, in particular to the streaming API of the xml-conduit package.

- [Nixify your haskell project: Introduction](https://zero-to-flakes.com/blog/nixify-haskell-project-intro) by Shivaraj B H
  > This is the start of a series of blog posts aimed at simplifying Haskell development & packaging workflow using Nix. In this post, we begin the series by nixifying a Haskell application that uses PostgreSQL database and package it for end-users to run with one command.

## Show & tell

- [A basic graphical text editor written in Haskell](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/a-basic-graphical-text-editor-written-in-haskell/7551) by ssddq
  > At the start, my goal was to learn how Vulkan and GPU programming/rendering worked in general; over time, this slowly morphed into trying to write a streaming-based text editor.
  
- [Haskell Foundation DevOps Weekly Log, 2023-09-06](https://discourse.haskell.org/t/devops-weekly-log-2023-09-06/7537) by Bryan Richter
  > Although my roadmap is still basically the one I laid out a couple posts back, I have been ill for part of last week and working on a few little side quests for the Haskell Foundation in the remainder of the time.
